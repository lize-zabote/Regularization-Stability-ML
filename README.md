# Assignment 3 — Regularization and Stability

**Statistical Methods for Machine Learning — A.Y. 2025/26**  
Instructor: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi  
Student: Lize Ana Zabote (V13380)

Based on: *Stability and Generalization* — Bousquet & Elisseeff, JMLR 2002.

## Overview

This project empirically studies the relationship between **regularization strength**, **algorithmic stability**, and **generalization performance** in linear regression.

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/assignment3.git
cd assignment3
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the experiments
```bash
python main.py
```

Plots are saved as individual PDF files in the `outputs/` directory.

## Algorithms (implemented from scratch)

| Model | Method | Regularization |
|---|---|---|
| Ridge regression | Closed-form `(X'X + λI)⁻¹ X'y` | L2 |
| OLS | Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse | None |

---

## Stability Metric

Following Bousquet & Elisseeff (2002), stability is estimated as:

$$\hat{\beta} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{|S_{\text{test}}|} \sum_{z \in S_{\text{test}}} |f_S(x) - f_{S \setminus i}(x)|$$

For each training point *i*, the model is retrained without it and the average absolute change in predictions on the held-out test set is recorded.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Type | Samples | Features | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Synthetic | Gaussian linear | 300 | 20 | Generated |
| Diabetes | Real-world | 442 | 10 | `sklearn.datasets` |
